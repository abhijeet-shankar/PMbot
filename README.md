## Overview
The Project Manager Assistant is a comprehensive solution for streamlining project management processes. Leveraging Machine Learning algorithms and advanced document processing techniques, this project aims to enhance decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and improve project outcomes across various industries.

## Features
- **Machine Learning-driven Priority Prediction**: Utilizes ML algorithms to accurately predict project priorities, aiding in effective resource allocation and task prioritization.
- **PDF Document Processing**: Efficiently processes PDF documents, segregating data into actionable statuses (pass, fail, undefined) with color-coded visualization for easy interpretation.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Incorporates a Tkinter GUI to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, enhancing accessibility and usability.

## Activities
1. **Machine Learning Priority Prediction**: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict project priorities based on historical data and relevant features.
2. **PDF Document Processing**: Develop mechanisms to extract structured data from PDF documents and categorize them into actionable statuses.
3. **GUI Development**: Design and implement a user-friendly interface using Tkinter to facilitate easy interaction and visualization of project statuses.
